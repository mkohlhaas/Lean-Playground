-- A do expression contains a sequence of statements, which may be:
-- · expressions that represent IO actions
-- · ordinary local definitions with let and := where the defined name refers to the value of the provided expression
-- · local definitions with let and ← where the defined name refers to the result of executing the value of the provided expression

-- Furthermore, if and match expressions that occur immediately under a do are implicitly considered to have their own
-- do in each branch. Inside of a do expression, nested actions are expressions with a left arrow immediately under
-- parentheses. The Lean compiler implicitly lifts them to the nearest enclosing do, which may be implicitly part of
-- a branch of a match or if expression, and gives them a unique name. This unique name then replaces the origin site
-- of the nested action.

-- functions whose definition is marked partial are not required to terminate
-- partial bc it calls itself recursively on input that is not immediately smaller than an argument -/
